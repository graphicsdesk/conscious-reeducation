              the United States. The stories of those first enslaved people and their descendants had long gone untold
              because the American education system does not center this profound, and shameful, truth as the seed from
              which we experience race in America today. </p>

            <p id="contextText"> As we watch the latest public outrage stemming from the murder of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and
            Ahmaud Arbery, some may find themselves experiencing dissonance that they had been so unaware of the
              history of policing, plantation capitalism, and racist government policies created with the intent to
              limit Black progress. The American education system does not prioritize the teaching of the enslavement
              period, or the idea of race and racism as evidenced by the lack of knowledge surrounding the economic and
              political achievements of communities of color. Many of us navigate the Pre-K-12 school experience, which
              includes state mandated assessments and honors and AP courses, and never learn about black wall street,
              black inventions, theories. The end result is that many of us go through our school careers racially
              illiterate, sensitive to the stress of conversations about race, and ignorant that our thoughts and
              behaviors fuel propagate white supremacy, even the most well-meaning amongst us. The reality is that skin
              color and zip code shape every experience in this country and act as determining factors for quality of
              life and life expectancy for those yet to be born. The solution is to unlearn the whitewashed curriculum
              we were immersed in for most of our lives and relearn the history of our founding through a conscious lens
              to truly understand what is happening in the streets and finally take anti-racist actions.
