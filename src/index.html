              the United States. The stories of those first enslaved people and their descendants had long gone untold
              because the American education system does not center this profound, and shameful, truth as the seed from

            <p id="contextText"> As we watch the latest public outrage stemming from the murder of George Floyd, Breonna
              Taylor, and
              Ahmaud Arbery, some may find themselves experiencing dissonance that they had been so unaware of the
              history of policing, plantation capitalism, and racist government policies created with the intent to
              limit Black progress. The American education system does not prioritize the teaching of the enslavement
              period, or the idea of race and racism as evidenced by the lack of knowledge surrounding the economic and
              political achievements of communities of color. Many of us navigate the Pre-K-12 school experience, which
              includes state mandated assessments and honors and AP courses, and never learn about black wall street,
              black inventions, theories. The end result is that many of us go through our school careers racially
              illiterate, sensitive to the stress of conversations about race, and ignorant that our thoughts and
              behaviors fuel propagate white supremacy, even the most well-meaning amongst us. The reality is that skin
              color and zip code shape every experience in this country and act as determining factors for quality of
              life and life expectancy for those yet to be born. The solution is to unlearn the whitewashed curriculum
              we were immersed in for most of our lives and relearn the history of our founding through a conscious lens
              to truly understand what is happening in the streets and finally take anti-racist actions.

            <p id="p1">The roots of race and racism in America go back to 1619 when that first ship arrived in the
              colony of Virginia. Without an understanding of what happened during that time period, you are unable to
              perceive systemic racism as a system of gears that act upon every aspect of society. Unless you can take
              this critical step back to see the entire system, you cannot recognize that the ways in which we’ve been
              socialized within American society has entrenched white supremacy deep into our collective psyche.
              <p id="p2"> Consider this: A well-meaning teacher, statistically a white woman, stands in front of a
                classroom filled with students of color. She tries to encourage them, urge them to do better, to
                graduate, enroll in college, so they could live in a better neighborhood. Unbeknownst to the teacher, a
                “better neighborhood” is subconsciously equated with a white neighborhood. “A better school district”
                usually corresponds with a whiter school district and so on. We already speak in the language of race
                everyday, why not do so from a point of consciousness so that we can truly understand our impact and how
                it aids in white supremacy. By exploring the resources provided throughout this project, you can start
                to build your knowledge and empathy of the history of this country, which was founded upon the social
                construction of race.

              <p id="claimTwoInfoText">In his work, Courageous Conversations about Race by Glenn E. Singleton, he urges
                us
                to
                examine race through the personal, local, and immediate. This forces us to understand our own beliefs,
                values, and expectations about race. This helps us to think more critically and empathetically about how
                we
                show up not only in the world, but any given space that we occupy. In American society today, it is
                difficult for us to connect our privileges, however it manifests, to the oppression of communities of
                color
                that are invisible to us because of historically redlined neighborhoods and present day discrimination
                within real estate. Even more, we buy into the idea that our privileges are earned due to “hard work”
                rather
                than critically interrogating the impact of generational wealth being as a result of stolen labor and
                racist
                government policies designed to limit the progress of communities of color. Our lack of exposure makes
                it
                easy to buy into the idea of “meritocracy,” while missing that this fictional narrative is a tool of
                white
                supremacy. As we question the qualifications of people of color in our school and workplaces, using
                affirmative action to maintain a sense of superiority, we must also recognize that the historic
                structures
                within American society have rooted affirmative action for white people in every aspect of life. As we
                consider our own experiences, studying the experiences of others helps us to better see how our false
                notions coincide with someone else’s oppression.
